#     The first step is to create a connection to the email server using the SMTP class from the smtplib
#     library. The server's address and port are passed to the constructor of the SMTP class,
#     and the connection is established. The server's address and port are obtained from the yaml file.
#
# The second step is to initiate a handshake with the server. The ehlo() method is used to
# send an extended hello command to the server, which starts the handshake process.
#
# The third step is to establish a secure connection with the server. The starttls() method
# is used to tell the server that we want to communicate with it using
# Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption. This step is optional but highly recommended.
#
# The fourth step is to authenticate with the server. The login() method is used
# to send the login credentials (username and password) to the server.
# These credentials are obtained from the yaml file as well
#
# The fifth step is to create the email message. A MIMEMultipart object is
# created and the various fields of the email message, such as the sender, recipient, subject,
# and message body, are set.
#
# The sixth step is to send the email message. The send_message() method is used
# to send the email message to the server.
#
# The final step is to check if the email was sent successfully and return
# the result. If the email was sent successfully, the function returns True,
# otherwise it returns False and print the exception error.
